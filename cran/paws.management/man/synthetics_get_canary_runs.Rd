\usage{
synthetics_get_canary_runs(
  Name,
  NextToken = NULL,
  MaxResults = NULL,
  DryRunId = NULL,
  RunType = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Name}{[required] The name of the canary that you want to see runs for.}

\item{NextToken}{A token that indicates that there is more data available. You can use
this token in a subsequent
\code{\link[=synthetics_get_canary_runs]{get_canary_runs}} operation to retrieve
the next set of results.

When auto retry is enabled for the canary, the first subsequent retry is
suffixed with *1 indicating its the first retry and the next subsequent
try is suffixed with *2.}

\item{MaxResults}{Specify this parameter to limit how many runs are returned each time you
use the \code{\link[=synthetics_get_canary_runs]{get_canary_runs}} operation. If
you omit this parameter, the default of 100 is used.}

\item{DryRunId}{The DryRunId associated with an existing canaryâ€™s dry run. You can use
this DryRunId to retrieve information about the dry run.}

\item{RunType}{\itemize{
\item When you provide \code{RunType=CANARY_RUN} and \code{dryRunId}, you will get
an exception
\item When a value is not provided for \code{RunType}, the default value is
\code{CANARY_RUN}
\item When \code{CANARY_RUN} is provided, all canary runs excluding dry runs
are returned
\item When \code{DRY_RUN} is provided, all dry runs excluding canary runs are
returned
