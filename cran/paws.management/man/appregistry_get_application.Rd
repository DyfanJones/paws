\title{Retrieves metadata information about one of your applications}
\usage{
appregistry_get_application(application)
}
\arguments{
\item{application}{[required] The name, ID, or ARN of the application.}
}
\description{
Retrieves metadata information about one of your applications. The application can be specified by its ARN, ID, or name (which is unique within one account in one region at a given point in time). Specify by ARN or ID in automated workflows if you want to make sure that the exact same application is returned or a \code{ResourceNotFoundException} is thrown, avoiding the ABA addressing problem.

See \url{https://paws-r.github.io/docs/appregistry/get_application.html} for full documentation.
