\usage{
eks_list_eks_anywhere_subscriptions(
  maxResults = NULL,
  nextToken = NULL,
  includeStatus = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{maxResults}{The maximum number of cluster results returned by
ListEksAnywhereSubscriptions in paginated output. When you use this
parameter, ListEksAnywhereSubscriptions returns only maxResults results
in a single page along with a nextToken response element. You can see
the remaining results of the initial request by sending another
ListEksAnywhereSubscriptions request with the returned nextToken value.
This value can be between 1 and 100. If you don't use this parameter,
ListEksAnywhereSubscriptions returns up to 10 results and a nextToken
value if applicable.}

\item{nextToken}{The nextToken value to include in a future ListEksAnywhereSubscriptions
request. When the results of a ListEksAnywhereSubscriptions request
exceed maxResults, you can use this value to retrieve the next page of
results. This value is null when there are no more results to return.}

\item{includeStatus}{An array of subscription statuses to filter on.}
