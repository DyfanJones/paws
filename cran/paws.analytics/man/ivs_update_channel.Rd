\title{Updates a channel's configuration}
\usage{
ivs_update_channel(
  arn,
  authorized = NULL,
  insecureIngest = NULL,
  latencyMode = NULL,
  name = NULL,
  recordingConfigurationArn = NULL,
  type = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{arn}{[required] ARN of the channel to be updated.}

\item{authorized}{Whether the channel is private (enabled for playback authorization).}

\item{insecureIngest}{Whether the channel allows insecure RTMP ingest. Default: \code{false}.}

\item{latencyMode}{Channel latency mode. Use \code{NORMAL} to broadcast and deliver live video
up to Full HD. Use \code{LOW} for near-real-time interaction with viewers.
(Note: In the Amazon IVS console, \code{LOW} and \code{NORMAL} correspond to
Ultra-low and Standard, respectively.)}

\item{name}{Channel name.}

\item{recordingConfigurationArn}{Recording-configuration ARN. If this is set to an empty string,
recording is disabled. A value other than an empty string indicates that
recording is enabled}

\item{type}{Channel type, which determines the allowable resolution and bitrate. \emph{If
you exceed the allowable resolution or bitrate, the stream probably will
disconnect immediately}. Valid values:
\itemize{
\item \code{STANDARD}: Video is transcoded: multiple qualities are generated
from the original input, to automatically give viewers the best
experience for their devices and network conditions. Transcoding
allows higher playback quality across a range of download speeds.
Resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to 8.5 Mbps.
Audio is transcoded only for renditions 360p and below; above that,
audio is passed through. This is the default.
\item \code{BASIC}: Video is transmuxed: Amazon IVS delivers the original input
to viewers. The viewerâ€™s video-quality choice is limited to the
original input. Resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up
to 1.5 Mbps for 480p and up to 3.5 Mbps for resolutions between 480p
and 1080p.

Updates a channel's configuration. This does not affect an ongoing stream of this channel. You must stop and restart the stream for the changes to take effect.
